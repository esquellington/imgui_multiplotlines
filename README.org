#+STARTUP: indent
* Intro
[[ImGui::MultiPlotLines]] aims to be a simple drop-in replacement of
[[ImGui::PlotLines()]] to draw multiple channels simultaneously, and adds
some nice optional features on top.
** TODO Screenshot/GIF
* Features
- Plot view shows N channels simultaneously that can be hovered and selected
- Legend view shows channel names, colors and status (hovered,selected)
- Channels can have a user-defined name, colour and parent channel
- Channels can be shown/hidden
- Channels can be highlighted when hovered in both Plot and Legend
** TODO GIF
* Using
See [[ImGui::MultiPlotLines_Demo()]] for example code showing how to use
most available features.

Basic usage is similar to [[ImGui::PlotLines()]], and only requires the
following changes:
- Providing a get_value() function pointer that accepts and additional
  channel_idx parameter
- Providing the number of channels

Advanced usage requires passing an non-null
[[ImGui::MultiPlotLines_Params]] struct pointer, that can be persistent
or non-persistent.

Non-persistent params allow fine-tuning the Plot/Legend appearance and
enable some minimal interaction:
- Enable/Disable per-channel visibility
- Enable Legend and other UI elements
- Filter channel data
- RW_HoveredChannelIdx and RW_SelectedChannelIdx can be queried after
  drawing, but will be reset on next call

Persistent params allow tracking and interactive modification of
read-write parameters (prefixed by RW_):
- Toggle channel visibility
- Toggle channel selection
- Hide/Show Legend interactively
- Highlight Plot channels when hovering over Legend entries (hovered
  Plot channels will be highlghted in Legend, but not the other way around)
* Installation
Copy imgui_multiplot.h/cpp to your project folders or your ImGui installation
* Limitations
User-defined get_value() functions can easily work around these, but
I've tried to keep the API and default behaviour as simple as possible:
- All plots use the same vertical range
- All channels are assumed to have the same number of samples (horizontal range)
- No support for values_offset or overlay_text, available in [[ImGui::PlotLines()]]
* Potential improvements
** TODO Legend placement options
- Legend could be optionally placed beside/above Plot, instead of below
** TODO Plot axis labels and scale
- Draw text labels on both axis
- Draw range/ticks on both axis
** TODO Plot navigation: zoom, pan, selection
** TODO Channel hierarchy view
- Alternative Legend view that shows channels as a collapsable
  hierarchy instead of a column-based layout
** TODO Generic MouseClickAction
- One possible MCA would be to open a popup/context menu with all
  potential actions on a channel, so that we don't need to decide
  beforehand how do we bind 2 mouse buttons to several possible
  actions
- Other actions could be added, maybe passing a user-defined function pointer
